- Edge case: when 'select all x versions' is checked, where x is the model, all models in that family are checked BUT if one or more are unchecked, 'select all x verisions' is not unchecked (it should be): trying to do so results in the following (when tested on the deepseek-r1 family): streamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: st.session_state.select_all_deepseek-r1 cannot be modified after the widget with key select_all_deepseek-r1 is instantiated
- 'In progress...' should not display when 'Enable streaming' is checked, only when it is unchecked
- Elements (checkboxes, sliders) from red -> blue
