- 'Select All Models' formatted under button -> format to beside button
- fix Details popup (completely broken, will have to try using builtin streamlit functionality)
- Display generating responses only when streaming unchecked
- Move entire progress section above streamed response
- Elements (checkboxes, sliders, button hover, etc.) from red -> blue
- 'Select All' in a given model family leaves models in that family unchecked, allowing for duplicates
- Debug Information dropdown broken -> disappears when opened
