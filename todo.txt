- 'Select All Models' selects all models but does not display checkbox selections after the first family dropdown. This allows for duplicates, if an unchecked checkbox is checked. To keep it simple, if select all models is checked, the dropdowns should disappear.
- Edge case: when one model is selected, should be 'selected 1 model' not 'selected one models'
- Edge case: when 'select all x versions' is checked, where x is the model, all models in that family are checked BUT if one or more are unchecked, 'select all x verisions' is not unchecked (it should be)
- Display 'Generating responses...' only when streaming is unchecked
- Elements (checkboxes, sliders) from red -> blue
